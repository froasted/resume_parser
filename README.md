# Resume Parser
Extracts meaningful information (email-id, phone numbers and skills) from resumes.

## Requirements
The following packages are required to run the code :

**Python 3.7+**

- **pandas** (pip install pandas)

- **nltk** (pip install nltk)

- **pdfminer** (pip install pdfminer) 

- **docx2txt** (pip install docx2txt)

## Files
- [resume_parser.ipynb](https://github.com/froasted/resume_parser/blob/master/resume_parser.ipynb) : This is a jupyter notebook which contains all the codes and explanations related to the analysis.
- [skills.csv](https://github.com/froasted/resume_parser/blob/master/skills.csv) : The resume uses data from this file to identify all the skills. This data was not accumulated by me and was randomly found on the [internet](https://github.com/robinsones/Freelancer-Shiny-App/blob/master/skills.csv).
